Students will learn how to apply database systems concepts and principles to develop client/server applications that interface client-side code with databases.

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  By using organized, industry standard practices to create my code. This includes proper indentations, descriptive variable names, and comments. The CRUD         module that was created could easily be modified for other projects. Because of the way the code is set up, it can be easily reused with a few line changes.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  Incremental steps and testing. I implemented each part of the system, testing as each was added to ensure correct functionality. This is how I approach most     projects as adding small portions at a time save time if a mistake or error is encountered. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  There are many different types of computer scientist, and they do a wide variety of jobs. One of the main themes I have found across all of my courses is       computer scientist solve problems and puzzles. Work on a project like this could help companies find what they need fast and with low overhead. The dashboard   makes the job of searching the animals int eh database fast, effective, and expandable.
